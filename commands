# Transforming the extentionless files into json using Apache Tika 5/12
# You should have tika-app-1.19.1.jar file in the same folder when using these commands
# in command prompt:

# C:\Users\Anna\Desktop\KIK-LG211 Building NLP applications\Mainokset>java -jar tika-app-1.19.1.jar -j 5 > 5.json

# This makes a json file from one file but you should learn how to make it to the whole folder (or bash script)
# (-i inputdir -o outputdir but this did not work) -> see the batch mode in java -jar tika-app-1.19.1.jar --help

# I (Elina) have these files now in Ubuntu (Linux in Windows):

# ~/KIK-LG211/Mainokset/Mainoskokokansio/Mainoksia]$ file2json.sh

# file2json.sh file includes the script for making json files from all the extentionless files in a folder
# since the files are named as numbers like 1, 10 etc. The json files are output into a folder json_postit:

mkdir -p json_postit

for f in `ls | grep "^[0-9][0-9]*$"`
do
java -jar tika-app-1.19.1.jar -j $f > json_postit/$f.json
done
